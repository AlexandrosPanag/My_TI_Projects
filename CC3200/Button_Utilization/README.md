Button Utilization
-----------------------

This project takes a user input by pressing one of the built-in on board buttons and then turning on a different LED (by pressing right button to turn on the RED LED and left button for the GREEN_LED). The code can be further adjusted considering, the CC3200 XL has also another YELLOW_LED for more expirementations.
