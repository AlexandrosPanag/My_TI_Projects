Internal Temperature Sensor
---------------------------------

Texas Instrument cc3200 Launchpad This microcontroller also has built in sensor at the sensor area which are temperature sensor and accelerometer sensor. Temperature sensor is to monitor the surrounding temperature meanwhile for the accelerometer sensor used to sense the motion.

This project can help the utilization of the internal built-in temperature possible. I've also encountered a +-1-2 Celsius difference between the CC3200'S sensor and the DHT11 sensor (while connected to an ESP32) .
