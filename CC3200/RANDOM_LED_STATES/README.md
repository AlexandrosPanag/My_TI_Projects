RANDOM LED STATES
--------------------

This program can help generate random numbers and then make the LED Lights blink accordingly, if the randomly generated number can be modulated then the LED turn on -- (the same process will be repeated 3 times for each one of our 3 built-in LED lights thanks to our randX integers), if the number can't be modulated, then the LED will be turned off
